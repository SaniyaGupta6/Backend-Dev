--------------------------------------Answers:---------------------------------------------

1.Synchronous file operations stop the program and wait until the file work is done. Nothing else runs in between.Asynchronous operations don’t stop the program — the code keeps running while the file is being read or written using callbacks or promises. That’s why async is better for real applications.

2.You should use file streams when the file is big. Streams read the file little by little instead of loading the whole thing into memory, so it saves memory and works faster.

3.utf8 is used when the file has normal text in it. It helps Node.js read or write the content as readable text.
If you don’t use utf8, the file is treated like binary data and comes as a buffer

4.Some common error codes are:
ENOENT = the file or folder doesn’t exist
EACCES = permission is denied
EEXIST = the file already exists
EISDIR = it expected a file but found a folder
ENOTDIR = it expected a folder but found a file

5.You can delete a folder along with everything inside it by using the remove method with recursive and force options. This removes the directory and all files inside safely.

6.Piping means directly sending data from one stream to another.
For example, you can read a file using a read stream and directly write it into another file using a write stream. The data flows automatically.

7.Error handling is important because files might not exist, permissions can be denied, or something can go wrong. Handling errors helps the program run safely and not crash suddenly.

8.writeFile replaces the old content or creates a new file.
appendFile adds new content at the end of the file without removing the old data.
